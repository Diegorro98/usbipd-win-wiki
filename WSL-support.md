# WSL convenience commands

After following the setup instructions below, you can use the WSL convenience
commands to easily attach devices to a WSL instance and view which distributions
devices are attached to.

```pwsh
> usbipd wsl list
BUSID  DEVICE                                      STATE
1-7    USB Input Device                            Not attached
4-4    STMicroelectronics STLink dongle, STMic...  Not attached
5-2    Surface Ethernet Adapter                    Not attached

> usbipd wsl attach --busid 4-4
[sudo] password for user:

> usbipd wsl list
BUSID  DEVICE                                      STATE
1-7    USB Input Device                            Not attached
4-4    STMicroelectronics STLink dongle, STMic...  Attached - Ubuntu
5-2    Surface Ethernet Adapter                    Not attached
```

Now the device is available in WSL.

```bash
$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0483:374b STMicroelectronics ST-LINK/V2.1
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

`wsl detach` can be used to stop sharing the device. The device will also
automatically stop sharing if it is unplugged or the computer is restarted.

```pwsh
> usbipd wsl detach --busid 4-4

> usbipd wsl list
BUSID  DEVICE                                      STATE
1-7    USB Input Device                            Not attached
4-4    STMicroelectronics STLink dongle, STMic...  Not attached
5-2    Surface Ethernet Adapter                    Not attached
```

Use the `--help` to learn more about these convenience commands. In particular,
the `--distribution` and `--usbippath` options can be useful to customize how
the WSL commands are invoked.

# Setting up USBIP on WSL 2

Update WSL:

```pwsh
wsl --update
```

List your distributions.

```pwsh
wsl --list --vebose
```

Verify that your target distribution is version 2;
see [WSL documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#set-your-distribution-version-to-wsl-1-or-wsl-2)
for instructions on how to set the WSL version.

Export current distribution to be able to fall back if something goes wrong.

```pwsh
wsl --export <current-distro> <temporary-path>\wsl2-usbip.tar
```

Import new distribution with current distribution as base.

```pwsh
wsl --import wsl2-usbip <install-path> <temporary-path>\wsl2-usbip.tar
```

Run new distribution.

```pwsh
wsl --distribution wsl2-usbip --user <user>
```

Update resources (assuming `apt`, you may need to use `yum` or another package manager).

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Install prerequisites.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential flex bison libssl-dev libelf-dev libncurses-dev autoconf libudev-dev libtool
```

Clone kernel that matches wsl version. To find the version you can run.

```bash
uname -r
```

The kernel can be found at: <https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel>

Clone the kernel repo, then checkout the branch/tag that matches your kernel version; run `uname -r` to find the kernel version.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel.git
cd WSL2-Linux-Kernel
git checkout linux-msft-wsl-5.10.43.3
```

Copy current configuration file.

```bash
cp /proc/config.gz config.gz
gunzip config.gz
mv config .config
```

You may need to set CONFIG_USB=y in .config prior to running menuconfig to get all options enabled for selection.

Run menuconfig to select kernel features to add.

```bash
sudo make menuconfig
```

These are the necessary additional features in menuconfig.\
Device Drivers -> USB Support\
Device Drivers -> USB Support -> USB announce new devices\
Device Drivers -> USB Support -> USB Modem (CDC ACM) support\
Device Drivers -> USB Support -> USB/IP\
Device Drivers -> USB Support -> USB/IP -> VHCI HCD\
Device Drivers -> USB Support -> USB/IP -> Debug messages for USB/IP\
Device Drivers -> USB Serial Converter Support\
Device Drivers -> USB Serial Converter Support -> USB FTDI Single port Serial Driver

In the following command the number '8' is the number of cores to use; run `getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN` to find the number of cores.

```bash
sudo make -j 8 && sudo make modules_install -j 8 && sudo make install -j 8
```

Build USBIP tools.

```bash
cd tools/usb/usbip
sudo ./autogen.sh
sudo ./configure
sudo make install -j 8
```

Copy tools libraries location so usbip tools can get them.

```bash
sudo cp libsrc/.libs/libusbip.so.0 /lib/libusbip.so.0
```

Install usb.ids so you have names displayed for usb devices.

```bash
sudo apt-get install hwdata
```

From the root of the repo, copy the image.

```bash
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /mnt/c/Users/<user>/usbip-bzImage
```

Create a `.wslconfig` file on `/mnt/c/Users/<user>/` and add a reference to the created image with the following.

```ini
[wsl2]
kernel=c:\\users\\<user>\\usbip-bzImage
```

Your WSL distro is now ready to use!
